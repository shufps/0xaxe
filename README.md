**WARNING**: The 0xAxe is the *end level boss for Pros*. It's hard to get it working properly. The main reason is the powering scheme that uses 4 different voltage domain. It's difficult to get it into balance properly and needs very good and uniform cooling. The device works but can be super frustrating until it really is mining as it should. 


# 0xaxe

0xAxe is a 16-ASIC-BM1366 Miner based on the [QAxe](https://github.com/shufps/qaxe)

**rev1**: not tested</br>
**rev1.1**: working but needs some manual fixes</br>
**rev1.2**: should be working without fixes, but not tested yet.</br>

0xAxe is working (see screenshot at the end of the page to get an impression what to expect) ðŸ¥³

**note**: The 0xAxe is not a stand-alone device because it only supports USB but it can be run connected to a Raspberry Pi without problems. Also multiple devices can be connected to a single Pi. 

ASICs
=====

The 0xAxe uses 16 ASICs of type BM1366

Compilation (Bootloader or CMSIS-DAP)
======================================

```bash
# install curl
sudo apt install curl

# install rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh

# add to ~/.bash.rc (afterwards, opening a new terminal is needed)
echo 'source "$HOME/.cargo/env"' >> ~/.bashrc

# clone repository
git clone https://github.com/shufps/0xaxe

# clone submodules
cd 0xaxe
git submodule init
git submodule update

# add rust target for STM32L0 variants
rustup target add thumbv6m-none-eabi

# build firmware for L072
cd firmware/fw-L072KZ
./build.sh
```

Installation via USB Bootloader on board with `BOOT` button
===========================================================
The STM32L072CB variant has an integrated DFU Bootloader that starts when pressing the `BOOT` button during reset.

Afterwards the firmware can be flashed via `dfu-utils`:

```bash
# install cargo-binutils and llvm tools
cargo install cargo-binutils
rustup component add llvm-tools-preview

# create the firmware.bin
DEFMT_LOG=info cargo objcopy --release --bin qaxe -- -O binary 0xaxe.bin

# install dfu-utils
sudo apt-get install dfu-util

now start the stm32 in DFU mode by pressing `boot` 

# after booting, list the devices
dfu-util --list

# flash the binary
dfu-util -a 0 -s 0x08000000:leave -D 0xaxe.bin
```


Installation via CMSIS-DAP Programmer
=====================================

**note**: Using CMSIS-DAP and PicoProbe is only interesting for developers trying to alter the firmware.

As programming/debug adapter the Picoprobe firmware running on a Raspi Pico works best: <br>
https://github.com/rp-rs/rp2040-project-template/blob/main/debug_probes.md / https://github.com/raspberrypi/picoprobe/releases/tag/picoprobe-cmsis-v1.0.3
<br>
<br>
There also is a little board with only 3 parts that gives a nice low-cost solution to flash the Qaxe:<br>
https://github.com/shufps/raspi-pico-dap

On `rev3` there should be the option to boot the stm32 (by pressing the `boot`-button on reset) into DFU-Bootloader mode what makes flashing via USB and without CMSIS-DAP programmer possible.

## Flashing

After the source was compiled it is flashed by:

```bash
# build firmware for L072
cd firmware/fw-L072KZ
# run firmware (this also flashes it to the stm32)
./run.sh
```
